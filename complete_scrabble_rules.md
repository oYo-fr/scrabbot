## 🎮 Game Flow

### 1. **Preparation**
- Each player draws 7 tiles from the bag
- The first word must pass through the center star of the board
- Play order is determined by random draw

### 2. **On Their Turn, a Player Can:**
- **Form a word** using their tiles
- **Pass their turn** (exchange tiles or pass)
- **Exchange tiles** (replace 1 to 7 tiles with new ones)

### 3. **Word Formation**
- Words must be **readable horizontally or vertically**
- Each new word must **touch at least one existing letter**
- All formed words must be **valid** (in the dictionary)
- Words can be **singular or plural**

## 🏆 Score Calculation

### **Special Squares:**
- **Red square (triple word score)**: The entire word is worth 3x its value
- **Pink square (double word score)**: The entire word is worth 2x its value
- **Dark blue square (triple letter score)**: The letter is worth 3x its value
- **Light blue square (double letter score)**: The letter is worth 2x its value

### **Calculation Rules:**
1. **Calculate the base value** of all letters in the word
2. **Apply letter multipliers** (light/dark blue)
3. **Apply word multipliers** (pink/red)
4. **50-point bonus** if the player uses all 7 tiles at once

### **Calculation Examples:**

#### 🇫🇷 **French Example:**
Word "CHAT" on a light blue square (C counts double) and a pink square (word counts double):
- Base value: C(3) + H(4) + A(1) + T(1) = 9 points
- C counts double: 9 + 3 = 12 points
- Word counts double: 12 × 2 = **24 points**

#### 🇺🇸 **English Example:**
Word "CAT" with W on a dark blue square (W counts triple) and a red square (word counts triple):
- Base value: C(3) + A(1) + T(1) = 5 points
- No letter multipliers applied
- Word counts triple: 5 × 3 = **15 points**

Note: Letter values differ between languages (French W=10pts, English W=4pts)

## 🎯 Special Rules

### **Blanks:**
- Can replace **any letter**
- **Worth no points**
- Once placed, the blank keeps its value for the rest of the game

### **Tile Exchange:**
- Allowed to replace 1 to 7 tiles
- Exchanged tiles return to the bag
- Player draws new tiles
- **Counts as a turn** (no score)

### **Pass Turn:**
- Player places no word
- **Counts as a turn** (no score)

## 🏁 End of Game

### **End Conditions:**
1. **A player uses all their tiles** AND there are no more tiles in the bag
2. **6 consecutive turns without score** (passes or exchanges)

### **Final Calculation:**
- **Deduct** the value of remaining tiles from each player's score
- **Add** the value of opponent's tiles to the winner's score
