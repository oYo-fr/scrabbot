# Terminal Echo Policy

## Mandatory Rule: No Multiline Echo Commands

When using the terminal, **NEVER** use multiline `echo` commands as they cause issues in the user's environment.

### Forbidden Commands

❌ **NEVER use multiline echo:**
```bash
echo "Line 1
Line 2
Line 3"
```

❌ **NEVER use echo with multiline strings:**
```bash
echo "✅ Task complete!

🔍 Summary:
• Item 1 ✅
• Item 2 ✅"
```

### Allowed Commands

✅ **Use single-line echo:**
```bash
echo "Task completed successfully!"
echo "All tests passed: 6/6"
echo "Project is ready for production!"
```

✅ **Use multiple single echo commands:**
```bash
echo "✅ Task completed!"
echo "🔍 Summary: All items processed"
echo "🚀 Ready for next step!"
```

### Why This Rule Exists

- **Environment Compatibility**: Multiline echo causes terminal issues in the user's WSL environment
- **Command Reliability**: Single-line commands execute more reliably
- **User Experience**: Prevents interrupted or cancelled commands

### Implementation

- Always use single-line `echo` statements
- Break multiline messages into multiple `echo` commands if needed
- Prefer concise, single-line status messages
- Use simple text without complex Unicode when possible

**Remember: Simple, single-line echo commands work best in this environment.**
