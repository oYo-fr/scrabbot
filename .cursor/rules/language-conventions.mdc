# Language Conventions

## Code and Files
All code, comments, documentation, variable names, function names, class names, file contents, and any text written in files MUST be in English. This includes:

- Variable and function names
- Class names and interfaces
- Comments and inline documentation
- README files and documentation
- Configuration files
- Test names and descriptions
- Error messages and logs
- Database schemas and table names
- API endpoint names and responses

## Conversations
All conversations with users should be conducted in French, but the code itself remains in English.

## Examples

✅ **Correct (English code):**
```python
def calculate_word_score(word: str, multipliers: dict) -> int:
    """Calculate the score for a word in Scrabble."""
    total_score = 0
    # Calculate letter scores
    return total_score
```

❌ **Incorrect (French code):**
```python
def calculer_score_mot(mot: str, multiplicateurs: dict) -> int:
    """Calculer le score d'un mot au Scrabble."""
    score_total = 0
    # Calculer les scores des lettres
    return score_total
```

This rule ensures consistency across the codebase while maintaining French communication with users.
