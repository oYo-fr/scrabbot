## Project Information
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/oYo-fr/scrabbot
- **Workspace**: /workspaces/scrabbot

## Development Workflow
1. **Branch Management**: If on main, create a new branch for each feature/fix (except for the first commit)
2. **Testing and Quality**:
   - Ensure the project builds correctly
   - Verify all tests pass before committing
   - Follow linter rules if configured
3. **Commits**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages in English

## Dependency Management
- **Installing New Dependencies**: Every time a new dependency is installed for the project, it must be properly configured for:
  - The devcontainer (update appropriate configuration files)
  - CI/CD (update workflows and dependency files)
- **Validation**: Ensure the dependency works correctly in both environments
- **Documentation**: Document the reason for adding the dependency if not obvious

## Best Practices
- Always read and understand existing code before making modifications
- Use English names for variables and functions in this project
- Document complex functions
- Manually test critical changes
